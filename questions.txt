1. 
    I want FETCH_DETAILS to be dispatched on page load when
I get to the details page, but how do I send the ID as a payload from there
to saga which calls fetchDetails?

2. 
    Am I rendering this correctly, with an index of 0? should I map through? 
Does that actually matter? Or am I setting inital state wrong?
